DATA -- Information on dataset used- Its freely available.
In this assignment we will study some of the weather data contained in the Global Historical Climate
Network (GHCN), an integrated database of climate summaries from land surface stations around the
world. The data covers the last 175 years and is collected from more than 20 independent sources,
each of which have been subjected to quality assurance reviews.
 Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)
 GHCN Daily
The daily climate summaries contain records from over 100,000 stations in 180 countries and territories
around the world. There are several daily variables, including maximum and minimum temperature, total
daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth; however, about half of the stations report precipitation only.
The records vary by station and cover intervals ranging from less than a year to 175 years in total.
The daily climate summaries are supplemented by metadata further identifying the stations, countries,
states, and elements inventory specific to each station and time period. These provide human readable
names, geographical coordinates, elevations, and date ranges for each station variable in the inventory.


The data was stored in hadoop cluster as the data szie is quite huge almost 100GB data.
